In my spare time, I read philosophical works about Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism (儒釋道) and study some divination or fortune-telling techniques (易經數術) from ancient China. Besides, I sometimes play [guitar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SU3S5UhBUUoE5TJy_hmK87xawhIVPJrA/view?usp=sharing) and [Guqin (古琴)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lA3CFnW4XLk4gSvLlmlt_FXuuK5w3zMz/view?usp=sharing) for recreation.

I expect most things to be organized, and that is precisely why I wish to code elegantly. I enjoy logging my daily activities and visualizing them - this helps me adjust my work-life balance and make better use of my time. Click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HwU6hjsAsYE5VIdbLdq3Xe1YJMJyeYqR?usp=sharing) to see some of my visualizations.
