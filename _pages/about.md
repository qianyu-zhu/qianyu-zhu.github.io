I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/) and [NYU Tandon](https://engineering.nyu.edu/) (co-affiliation), advised by Professor [Hongyi Wen](https://whongyi.github.io/). Prior to that, I did my undergrad at NYU Shanghai, where I was fortunate to receive research training under the guidance of Professor [Li Guo](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/li-guo). In 2023, I obtained my B.S. degree (CS major & Math minor) and graduated with the Dean’s Award in Computer Science, Data Science, and Engineering (top-1 honor in the department).

I‘m passionate about exploring the abstract correlations behind instances and facts. During undergrad, my research was dedicated to segmentation tasks in the computer vision field. Currently, my research interest lies in **utilizing multimodal data and large pre-trained models for practical applications of personalization**.

My recent work is about `personalized image generation`.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
