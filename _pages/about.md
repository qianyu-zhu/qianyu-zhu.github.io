I'm a Computational Science and Engineering Ph.D. student at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://cse.mit.edu/), working with Professor [Youssef Marzouk](https://uqgroup.mit.edu/home) in the [Uncertainty Quantification group](https://uqgroup.mit.edu/home). Prior to that, I did my undergrad at [NYU Shanghai](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/), where I was fortunate to receive research training under the guidance of Professor [Siran Li](https://siranlivictor.wixsite.com/maths) and Professor [Hao Ni](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=HNIXX56). During 2021--2022 I studyed in New York and did research on optimal control advised by Professor [Georg Stadler](https://math.nyu.edu/~stadler/), who led me to the spectacular world of computational math. In 2023, I obtained my B.S. degree (Honors Mathematics and Data Science).

My research interest is three-fold: `randomness`, `information`, and `theory & application`. I am excited about everything with a random nature, including uncertain objects (noisy data, dynamical systems), randomized methods (MCMC, Bayesian Inference), and food Safari. Beneath the chaos are always universal governing rules.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
